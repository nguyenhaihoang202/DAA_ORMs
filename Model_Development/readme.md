This folder documents the progressive development of the Bayesian ordinal models used in the thesis, and the codes during the internship that are not included in the thesis. It contains intermediate Stan code and test scripts that led to the final implementations (BALOR and BZIOLR).

This includes the usage of a small microbiome dataset (CRC dataset), and the datasets from MicrobiomeBenchmarkData.
